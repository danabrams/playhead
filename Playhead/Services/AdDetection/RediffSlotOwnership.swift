// RediffSlotOwnership.swift
// playhead-xsdz.29: the OFFLINE rediff width-oracle integration — the pure,
// deterministic core that turns a stored played-copy fingerprint stream (A) and
// a re-fetched B-side copy into played-timeline DAI ad slots, then into
// `SpliceSlotCandidate`s the REUSED-UNCHANGED `SpliceSlotDispositionEngine`
// consumes. The service wires this behind the flag family (default OFF) and
// materializes accepted slots via `SpliceSlotRewriter.apply(provenance: .rediffSlot)`.
//
// CONTRACT (strategy panel 2026-07-07): rediff is the SOLE production width
// SETTER. A decoded span WITHOUT an overlapping rediff slot falls through to
// STATUS-QUO transcript width (candidate `.slot == nil` → `.noSlot` → span
// unchanged) — it NEVER consults the acoustic `SpliceSlotResolver`. The acoustic
// channel is shadow/eval-only. This engine therefore never calls the resolver;
// it only produces candidates the shared disposition engine can grade.
//
// DOUBLE-GATE (design input 3, xsdz.27): a stored A-side stream is trusted only
// when BOTH (a) its `algorithmVersion` equals the current
// `ChromaFingerprinter.algorithmVersion` (defensive re-check; the store's fetch
// already enforces this, but the record carries the field and B is fingerprinted
// at the CURRENT version, so we re-assert it here), AND (b) its persisted
// `sourceAudioIdentity` equals the asset's CURRENT `assetFingerprint`. Without
// (b), an assetId reused for a re-download of DIFFERENT audio would return a
// version-matching but audio-MISMATCHED stream and silently misalign.
//
// EXTRACTOR IDENTITY (design input 2, xsdz.27): the B-side is fingerprinted via
// `EpisodeFingerprintCapture.fingerprints(mono16kHz:)` — the EXACT same
// resample(16k→11025 linear)→ChromaFingerprint path the A-side was captured
// with. The `(resampler + fingerprinter)` pair is ONE versioned unit; comparing
// A and B fingerprinted by different extractors is meaningless.
//
// RE-ENCODE GUARD (Megaphone/mgln.ai, spike §7): a per-stitch re-encoding CDN
// makes A and B fail to fingerprint-align anywhere (`alignedFractionB` collapses
// toward 0). Slots are trusted only when `alignedFractionB >= minAlignedFractionB`
// (0.5). Below that the whole rediff result is discarded → status-quo width.
//
// CONSUMER-SIDE CLEANUP (spike §4/§6.3): fingerprint dropouts around splices
// fragment slot edges (nikki-glaser: 18 A-side fragments), and an alignment
// breakdown can produce an implausibly long "slot" (casefile: a 29-minute span).
// So played slots are (1) FRAGMENT-MERGED across gaps ≤ `fragmentMergeGapSeconds`
// (3 s) and (2) DURATION-CAPPED: a slot longer than `maxSlotSeconds` (8 min) is
// an alignment breakdown, not an ad, and is dropped.
//
// PURITY: static functions over value types, `Foundation` only, deterministic,
// no I/O and no actor hops. The store read (A-side), the negative-bank verdict
// table, and the B-side fetch all live in the service; this engine takes them as
// inputs so its whole surface is offline-testable.
