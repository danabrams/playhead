// AutoSkipPrecisionGate.swift
// playhead-gtt9.11: Split detection recall from auto-skip precision.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// Before this file, the detector had ONE knob (the
// `SegmentAggregator.promotionThreshold = 0.40`) that conflated two very
// different operating goals:
//
//   Detection recall → "don't miss ads" (cheap: annoying when missed).
//   Auto-skip precision → "don't skip real content" (expensive: breaks trust).
//
// The 2026-04-23 expert review (§5) proposed three distinct operating
// layers, with different confidence floors and — crucially — an
// orthogonal **safety-signal conjunction** for auto-skip. This file is the
// downstream gate that turns an aggregator `AdSegmentCandidate` (or a
// single-window classifier result) into one of three classifications:
//
//   1. detectionOnly     — score below `uiCandidateThreshold`. No AdWindow
//                          persisted. Telemetry / replay-tool visibility only.
//                          (The aggregator today already filters below its
//                          own `promotionThreshold = 0.40`; this layer
//                          encodes that decision in a single place so the
//                          single-window fast path honors the same rule.)
//   2. uiCandidate       — score ≥ `uiCandidateThreshold` but either below
//                          `autoSkipThreshold` OR the safety-signal gate did
//                          not fire. Persisted as AdWindow with
//                          `eligibilityGate = "markOnly"`. Visible as
//                          "possible ad" in the UI; NEVER auto-skipped.
//   3. autoSkipEligible  — score ≥ `autoSkipThreshold` AND duration is
//                          plausible AND ≥1 safety signal fires. Persisted
//                          as AdWindow with `eligibilityGate = "eligible"`.
//                          Eligible for auto-skip via the orchestrator.
//
// Scope guardrails
// ----------------
// This file MUST NOT:
//   - invent new safety signals. gtt9.12 (acoustic refinement) and
//     gtt9.13 (catalog/fingerprint) will introduce richer ones. This file
//     consumes signals that already exist in the codebase today.
//   - calibrate thresholds on real data. gtt9.3 owns calibration. The
//     starting values (uiCandidate=0.40, autoSkip=0.55) are documented in
//     `AdDetectionConfig` and are NOT re-tuned here.
//   - modify `SegmentAggregator` internals.
//   - change `DecisionMapper` / `SkipPolicyMatrix` semantics — only the
//     `eligibilityGate` stamped on the output AdWindow, and the
//     `finalDecision.action` string logged for replay.
//
// Signal audit (2026-04-24)
// -------------------------
// Bead spec required ≥2 working safety signals. We ship five:
//
//   • strongLexicalAdPhrase          ← LexicalCandidate.categories
//   • sustainedAcousticAdSignature   ← FeatureWindow.musicBedLevel
//   • metadataSlotPrior              ← segment position / episodeDuration
//   • userConfirmedLocalPattern      ← UserCorrectionStore.correctionBoostFactor
//   • catalogMatch                   ← reserved; wired by gtt9.13, not here
//
// All five are available in the pipeline TODAY without changes to their
// source modules.
