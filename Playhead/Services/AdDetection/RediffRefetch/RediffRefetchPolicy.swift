// RediffRefetchPolicy.swift
// playhead-xsdz.28: the PURE, deterministic decision core for the rediff
// RE-FETCH policy — the production shadow mechanism that periodically re-fetches
// an episode's audio so the rediff width-oracle (xsdz.29 `RediffSlotOwnership`)
// can diff the played copy (A) against a fresh copy (B) and extract exact DAI
// slot boundaries. THIS file is offline/pure; the `RediffRefetchService` actor
// wires it to the BGTask scheduler and the network/file seams (default OFF).
//
// EVERYTHING here is derived from the xsdz.16 spike's MEASURED constraints
// (docs/xsdz16-rediff-spike.md); the numbers are NOT re-derived:
//
//   • ≥24h GATE (spike §4): rotation is 0/10 back-to-back, 2/10 an hour apart,
//     and only saturates (~85-90%) at a weeks gap. Re-fetching an episode
//     downloaded < ~24h ago is measured waste, so the FIRST attempt waits
//     `minimumAgeBeforeFirstAttempt` (24h) after download.
//   • ROTATION PRE-CHECK = ranged-GET head/tail sample compare (spike §5
//     Strategy C, §7): HEAD/ETag/conditional-GET are UNRELIABLE on real podcast
//     CDNs (podtrac length-flaps seconds apart; Acast HEAD returns
//     `content-length: 2`). So change-detection is a byte SAMPLE compare — head
//     64KB + tail 64KB + total length (the total read from a ranged GET's
//     `Content-Range`, NEVER from HEAD). Identical sample → very likely
//     unchanged → SKIP the full fetch. Any difference → full re-fetch. Sizes
//     changed in 10/10 observed rotations, so a mid-file-only rotation with an
//     identical head/tail/length is the (low) residual risk the periodic
//     unconditional retry budget bounds.
//   • BACKOFF + RETRY BUDGET (spike §6.2): on an UNCHANGED pre-check, back off
//     (1d → 2d → 4d) and give up after `maxUnchangedAttempts` (baked-in-only
//     shows never rotate, so re-fetching them nightly forever is pure waste).
//     A detected rotation is TERMINAL (`resolved`) — the width oracle has its
//     B-side; no further re-fetch is scheduled for that episode.
//
// PURITY: value types + `static` functions, `Foundation`/`CryptoKit` only,
// deterministic, no I/O, no time source (the caller passes `now`), no actor
// hops. The whole decision surface is unit-testable without a network or a
// device.
