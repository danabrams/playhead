// AnalysisPipelineStallInvariantHarnessIntegrationTests.swift
// playhead-pd0q: GENERAL pipeline-stall regression harness.
//
// The two gy2s suites are incident PINS — they reproduce the exact
// 2026-07-20 dogfood signature (4 queued preAnalysis jobs, 0 running) with
// a single fixture:
//   - `AnalysisPipelineStallRegressionTests` (scheduler/store/reconciler)
//   - `AnalysisPipelineStallBackgroundEntryPointsIntegrationTests` (BGTasks)
//
// This suite closes the gap between "the one incident" and "the CLASS of
// pipeline stalls". It asserts the four pd0q invariants GENERALLY — every
// one is a Swift Testing `@Test(arguments:)` parameterized over a RANGE of
// states (queue depths, job-type mixes, epoch gaps, background entry
// points) so a FUTURE stall of the same class goes red, not only a
// byte-for-byte replay of the incident. All drive the REAL
// `AnalysisWorkScheduler` / `AnalysisStore` / `AnalysisJobReconciler` /
// `BackgroundProcessingService` + `AnalysisJobRunner` at the integration
// level, and all are deterministic + event-driven (each drain awaits its
// job to a terminal fixed point via a failing decode; no wall-clock poll).
//
// pd0q invariant → test:
//   1 DRAIN / liveness   — `invariant1_drainIsLiveAcrossDepthsAndJobTypes`
//   2 EPOCH survival     — `invariant2_epochSurvivalIsGeneralAcrossGaps`
//   3 BACKGROUND progress— `invariant3_bothBackgroundEntryPointsDispatch`
//   4 RECOVERY visibility— `invariant4_recoveryJobsSeenMatchesEligibleCount`
